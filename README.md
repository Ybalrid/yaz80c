# Yet Another Z80 Computer

This repository contains all the files for a personal project of mine: build a 8bit computer all by myself.

yaz80c is an **extremly** simple z80 computer, it it's most basic form, it's just a z80 glued to some rom, some ram, a serial I/O and a stupid clock circuit that permit you to make it go slower or faster to just see what's going' on!

Goal is to make a platform that is really easy to fully understand and to write some lowest-level code possible

See specs folder for documentation
See main_rom for embeded software
See emulator folder for a PC emulator (will either be wrote from scratch or be some config/stuff for MESS or MAME)
