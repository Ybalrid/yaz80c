# MAME

This homebrew computer project was added to a fork of MAME you can check out here, the "yaz80c" branch : https://github.com/Ybalrid/mame 

The computer in MAME was added as a machine called "yaz80c", manufactured by "Ybalrid", with no good ROM dump as the rom is under development here for obvious reason.

You need to build MAME, you can build only the yaz80c driver (if you don't it's gonna take ages). Please refer to MAME's documentation about how to do so.
